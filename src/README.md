**READ ME**

This is the first assignment for the mult 213 course. It involves putting into practice what we have learned about 
Asynchronous JavaScript Webpage, in which we have to apply two different API endpoints, while maintaining clean and 
functional code with a visually appealing layout.

**This is my reflection of this assignment**

After a long time away from JavaScript, here we are.

At first, I was a little confused about what kind of files I should use to test the APIs, and then how to connect my files (HTML, API, app, DOM) to each other, but this was my process:

First, I reviewed the course material to understand the general concept and exactly what I had to do for the assignment.

Next, I used an example the instructor had done in class to try and replace his data with mine. (By the way, I used AI to guide me through the process; I share the chat log with the instructor when I submit the assignment.)

I did well creating the structure and duplicating the documents. I find it easier to create the repository directly on GitHub because it gives you the option to apply `.gitignore` on the fly, without having to do it manually.

One of the mistakes I made was not bundling after making large changes to the code, and nothing was working. After investigating with my "assistant" (Copilot) I was able to correct the error, but it happened to me several more times, because I always forgot to do the bundle.

I had trouble pushing my code due to an error in the authentication of my Github and Git account.
Since I have my private email in the privacy settings, but Github gives me one email per user that I had to log in with in order to push the code.
Then the terminal gave me another error because a (.git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp) file was duplicated.
I had to ask my "assistant" how to delete it and upload it again, but I could have done it directly in the terminal because it gave me the option to delete it by pressing 'D'.

For improvements, I would have enhanced the overall design, adding more movement and animation to the final product. I decided to leave it with editable colors and not add a media folder because I think it would take more time, and I'm also worried that adding more styling might break something or prevent it from being saved correctly, resulting in the final product not being reflected. With more time, I could definitely do it.
